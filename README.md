# XGBoost
Detecting Parkinsonâ€™s Disease with XGBoost
      
   Parkinson's disease: 
       Is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination. Parkinson's symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking.It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.
       
 There are three types of Boosting
 1. Adaptive boosting
2. Gradient boosting
3. XGBoost
       
       
      
      
      XGBoost
      It means extreme gradient boosting. Boosting falls under the category of the distributed machine learning community. XGBoost is a more advanced version of the gradient boosting method. The main aim of this algorithm is to increase speed and to increase the efficiency of your competitions.It supports parallelization by creating decision trees. There's no sequential modeling in computing methods for evaluating any large and any complex modules.XGBoost also includes a variety of regularization techniques that reduce overfitting and improve overall performance. You can select the regularization technique by setting the hyperparameters of the XGBoost algorithm.
